lmbench will run with a bit of prodding:
1. must enable the DEVTTY option in the libc GNUmakefile until that day
	where we have tty support
2. The results will be placed in lmbench/Results/bsd, but to view them you
	should copy the resulting file into the same directory but on
	an OpenBSD machine and run make in the Result directory there for
	two reasons:
	1. we don't have perl5 compiling and running properly at the moment
	2. the loader doesn't assume /bin/sh script for unrecognized
		executables

Also, it really does take a while to run, so unless it gives an error
message just assume it's working.
