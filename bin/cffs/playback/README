playback.c	Source code for the aging program.  
master		Aging workload used in the USENIX paper.  This simulates
		300 days of activity on a 500 MB file system.
run_it		Sample script for running the aging program.  This builds
		a file system with the same parameters that I used, and then
		runs the aging program on it.  If you use this, you will
		want to change the device names and the mount point to
		correspond to your system.

The usage of the playback program is explained in the opening comments of
playback.c.  Note that the inodes per cylinder group and the number of
cylinder groups should be set according to the file system that the
aging workload was generated from.  See run_it for the correct parameters.

The workload file (master) contains a line reading "SCORE" after each day
of activity.  If the -c option to playback is used, you can specify a
command, or script, to be executed each time playback encounters a 
score directive.  This is how I computed the daily layout scores in
Figures 1 and 2 of the paper.  The scoring tools that I used are 
available from http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~keith/usenix.1995.html
I will make the correct script, using these tools, available here soon.
