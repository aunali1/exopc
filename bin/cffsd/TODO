1) revoke mappings in cffsd
2) pass (dev/block) pairs, not (eid,vaddr) pairs when referencing blocks
3) maintain and use types to make sure we're updating what we think we're updating
4) pass out sub-pxn's of the cffs pxn that give ONLY the access allowed
5) verify write orderings and figure out how to do 'tainted' handling
6) switch over to locking instead of EnterCritical/ExitCritical
7) generally make sure clients can't crash cffsd
