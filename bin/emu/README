How to use the OpenBSD emulator:

* Do a gmake install in the bin/emu directory.
* type 'emulate' to get get usage info
* you can set the EMULATOR environment variable to /bin/emulate and the loader
  will automatically run the emulator run unrecognized binares. (but you
  can't use the extra command line arguments to the emulator this way)

There are some options. The neatest of which will keep a log file of
all syscalls and their arguments.

To run Mosaic:
emulate Mosaic http://pdos/

* currently lib/libc/os/shexec.c needs to be redone to work properly
  with OpenBSD programs - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
