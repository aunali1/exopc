1.  Compiling xok with monitor support

If xok crashes in arpd while booting, due to a page fault (read
non-present page) perhaps related to wk stuff, ensure:
  unset INITPROG
  -g -O6 is present in GNUmakefile.global

If while booting xok prints "start running scheduler" and it halts,
check that _everything_ is compiled with EXO_HOST or not, no mix.
"make clean" and start fresh.



This is the stack.  Ugly bugger, ain't it?
