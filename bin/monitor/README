To compile xok for use with the monitor, you have to do a little setup
first.  Primarily this is because syscall.conf and trap.conf are not
preprocessed, and I've got too much to do too muck with makefiles.

In exopc/src/conf/trap.conf, change this line:
0x0d	tNT	$UIDT_VECT_TO_ADDR(0x0d)	# GPF
to this:
0x0d	iAe	general_protection_fault	# GPF (for monitor)

In exopc/src/conf/syscall.conf, add these system calls:
0x9c    set_gdt         int, u_int, u_int, struct seg_desc *
0x9d    run_guest       int, u_int, struct Trapframe_vm86 *, u_int, u_int
0x9f    set_tss         int, u_int, u_int16_t
0x98    set_ldt         int, u_int, u_int16_t
The system call numbers don't matter; just use 4 that are free.

Finally, be sure that EXO_HOST is set when compiling xok:
export EXO_HOST=1

make
make install
Edit and copy your monitor.conf to /etc.


Two tweaks to the Linux source before it'll work at all.  See the Linux
hacks in BUGS.
