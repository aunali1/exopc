How to get perl5 to run on xok
------------------------------

To prevent unnecessary bloating and tweaking of makefiles perl5 is not
checked into the xok tree.  Instead, get perl5 from OpenBSD directory
/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/perl and replace 'config.sh.OpenBSD' with the one
provided here.  Then, compile on an xok machine - it probably won't work
with CFFS until the "move-a-file-between-directories" capability is
provided by CFFS.  When compiling over NFS the times on the server and
client must be close enough for proper make file execution.  Also, for
the make to go at a decent pace, be sure you've replaced /usr/lib/libc.a
with /usr/lib/libexos.so_stub.o.

The proper commands are:
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

Dont forget to remove the old perl4 binary (the perl5 binary is placed
in /usr/bin):
rm /usr/local/bin/perl

The differences in the 'config.sh.OpenBSD' file result from missing
functionality in xok: compatible shm, msg, and sem support mostly, plus
the poll system call, dynamic loading of shared objects, safe setuid,
indirect system calls, and SDBM.

The test suite (make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper test) will fail on some
tests and then get stuck on some tests.  Executing the "get stuck" tests
individually yields success.  The failed tests don't appear to be
serious enough to worry about now.
