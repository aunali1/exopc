We are starting a new documentation effort (some would say we're starting
our first documentation effort...) Anyway, tex/guide.tex is a first
stab at an "Installation and Booting" guide for the system while
tex/internals.tex gives a high-level tour of the system sources.
Misc info about profiling, debugging, writing libos code that deals
with signals, and our old getting started files can be found in this
directory. Note that the TeX files contain the latest information
and should be considered the primary reference.
