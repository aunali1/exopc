HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS TO BUILD AND USE THE XOK EXOKERNEL

To Build you need:
OpenBSD with gcc 2.7.2.1 (it should work with 2.7.2)
or
linux with libc6 and the cross-compiling tools supplied

Currently the system only boots off a openbsd boot loader from an
openbsd partition.

To Run you need:
-Pentium, Pentium Pro, or Pentium II class machine.

SCSI:
-NCR 810/815/875 chipset SCSI Card
	-any scsi disk
Ethernet Cards supported:
SMC Elite 16
SMC EtherEZ 
	although you need to run the ezsetup.exe to set the card in:
	I/O Base Address 280:	IRQ 2:	RAM Address d0000:
	wait states = no:  net connection type = 1 :	ROM disabled = yes
EtherPower 10/100.  Pass 1.2 and 2.0 cards work for us.
D-Link DFE 500TX

Display Adapter:
	We currently only use the machine in text mode.  so the
	internal or default adapter should be fine.

We currently mount the root off an nfs server.  So you will need to
use an NFS server to mount the root of the machine (after that you can
switch the root to a local disk).  

Optionally, if you want to make machines easy to configure you can
also use a BOOTP daemon, so that it can get important information at
boot time, rather than having it hardcoded into the first
process. (more information about this in the BOOTING file).
