There are currently 3 implementations of terminals:

Old terminals:
/oev/[pt]ty[a-g] used by rconsoled.  Very simple, follow line semantics for read.
	Support only a handful of ioctl.

Nterminals:
/dev/[pt]typ[0-7] this were the first real pseudo terminals.  Allows us to run
	telnetd, vi.  Supports most ioctl.  Does not support process groups.
	select predicates based on polling every 50ms.

New Terminals:
Overlap the same namespace as nterminals.  Only one of these two can
be active at a time.  To use the New terminals, define NEWPTY on your
environment (setenv NEWPTY) and look at the comments in
libexos/GNUmakefile.inc

/dev/[pt]typ[0-7] Eventually it will be a full implemetation of pseudo terminals
	supporting process groups, and properly handling signals.


Right now nterminals are used by default
