crt0.o contains prologue, epilogue, fault handler, and ash code.  "start" is the
default entry code, which exists outside this file (in libc/os/xrt0.c).

There are no external dependencies for Ashes since they are self contained.
The external dependencies for the prologue, epilogue and fault handler code are:

* ___u_pending_sigs
* _DeliverPendingSignal
function to deliver pending unix signals

* ___CheckAlarm
checks the timers and queues a SIGALRM for delivery.

* ___stkbot
bottom of the stack (os/xrt0.c)

* ___u_fpu
flag if fpu is enabled

* ___u_in_critical
* ___u_interrupted
flag if code is in a critical region, if so return to the code.

* ___u_ppc
contains pc value of last instruction where process lost
time slice, used in epilogue

* ___u_xesp
pointer to exception stack.

* _do_cow_fault
function for copy on write fault handler.

* _exit
exit in case we fail to allocate a new page.

* _kprintf
prints to the console (stdio/kprintf.c)

* _signal_vec
used to reference the unix signal handler for a seg fault.

* _vpd
* _vpt
virtual page directory and page table.

* start
Where the program starts executing found in (libc/os/xrt0.c)
