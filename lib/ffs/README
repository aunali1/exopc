This is a very basic FFS implementation.  It's missing a bunch
of functionality, but should be sufficient for init to be able
to get other programs (like file servers) running.

ffs.c: basic interface routines (init, shutdown)

ffs_file.c: file i/o and management routines
 (open, close, fstat, lseek, read, write, unlink)

ffs_dir.c: directory management (opendir, readdir, closedir, mkdir, rmdir)

ffs_internal.c: some internal functions (lookup et al, read/write block/inode)

ffs_bmap.c: bmap routine (from bsd)
ffs_balloc.c: balloc routine (from bsd)
ffs_alloc.c: allocation routines (from bsd)
ffs_subr, ffs_tables: support for ffs_alloc (from bsd)

What it doesn't do:

- CACHING
- creating hard links
- creating/removing/following symlinks
- removing very large files (ones which use double indirect blocks)
- truncating files (even short ones)
- renaming/moving files
- security (it assumes you're "root")
- if lseek extends a file, new space in a previously partial block
  may not be 0 filled
