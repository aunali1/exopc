This file describes the changes from OpenBSD's files.
tty_subr.c:
	-has clist management routines.  
	We make use of variable CLALLOCSZ (==1024), and variable
	NCLISTS (for bitmask alloctaion).  
	We use the define STATIC_ALLOCATION, to determine where we
	"malloc" the clists from.
	
	renamed putc and getc to cl_putc and cl_getc
	removed a couple of unnecessary header files

tty_pty.c:
	pt_softc struct is allocated by pt_softc_init
	the prototype to ttymalloc is changed to include minor number

	tty_attach and tty_detach are disbled since no need to keep a
tty_tty.c:
	replaced by ctty.c

terminal list

	renamed ttyflush to __ttyflush

sys/tty.h made it practically identical.

sw.c takes the role of tty_conf.c

subr_xxx.c: same as OpenBSD
subr_uio.c: similar to kern_subr.c of OpenBSD

os/synch.c: implements tsleep and wakeup, similar to kern_synch.c of OpenBSD

ttymalloc, clalloc, and clfree, are not used because the tty structures are 
preallocated
