udp,tcp are simplistic UDP and TCP libraries.  Very small and should
be easier to understand than other implementations/libraries.

They should be fully functional except for 2 differences:

1) they use the ASH interface to the network, which requires enabling
ASHes (see lib/libexos/GNUmakefile.inc for some more information).
The other implementations (like the ones used: lib/libexos/fd/udp,
lib/xio (for TCP)) use the packet ring interface to the network
hardware.

2) they use hardcoded name/ip/ethernet mappings from hosttable files. 
This hardcoded table is obsoleted by a real card interface and routing
capabilities of ExOS (<exos/net/{if.h,route.h}>) and DNS from libc.

the hosttable files (netinet/hosttable) can be used independently for
testing and playing around with the network without having to rely on
DNS.
