libgmp can be compiled under xok

just get the source from OpenBSD (/usr/src/gnu/lib/libgmp) and replace
the Makefile.bsd-wrapper file with the one provided here and then type:

make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper

and

make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install


The only change is to the lines which run the configure program such
that it is forced to assume the host is i386-unknown-openbsd2.3 instead
of having to guess (and then failing since xok is unknown).
