The following items, in no particular order, are still needed for vos. I am
sure there are more, these are the ones I can think of right now.

Feature related:

- multithread: before any major feature is added, would probably be good to
  multithread vos so future updates/additions would just following the same
  sync/locking convention within the library - take a look at libpwafer for
  how to get multiple envs to run in the same address space...

- implement ioctl
- implement signals
- implement exec
- need to support entire libc
- support for ttys, interface with exos tty
- nfs support
- libfs
- virtualization scheme for extensions
- paging

- cleanup xio, possibly redo how socks and info are created and shared 
  - see benjie's thesis for example

- real capabilities
- ELF and ELF shared libraries

- multiprocessor scheduler


Bug fix related:

- recovery from bad fork (e.g. dec ref for file descriptors); 
  need general inverse of before_fork_handlers.
- make a dpf library - extract useful stuff from xok/dpf dir 
- add udp frag support for vos

- add page revocation requests to wk predicates

- freelist in mem allocator should be linear in pg number so adj pages 
  can be coalesed

- mem allocator to return pages to pager
- sbuf to return pages to pager
- sbuf allocator should do more coalesing of existing free sbufs
- each sbuf only up to 4k right now
