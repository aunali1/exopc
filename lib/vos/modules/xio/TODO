Things that are broken now that needs to be fixed:

  1. shared_malloc is used to allocate memory for descriptors, etc.
     if a parent forks, and closes its descriptor, the only copy left is
     in child. so when child closes, it does shared_free. But we really
     want the parent to do shared_free.

     solution: place the shared_malloc-ed memory as resources in the 
     proc structure for parent to collect on wait() syscall

  2. integration with fd: some xio operations block (for example, in accept
     we go to wk pred and wait for connection), so the operation hoards the
     shared lock that is used in the untrusted sync protocol. but since we
     don't really use that protocol to sync access to socket descriptors 
     (don't need to), should move these xio operations out of that lock.
     also see fd.h and fd.c
