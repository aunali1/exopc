Synchronization

Procedures that are synchronized are tagged with SYNC at the end of the
declaration. For example,

extern void sched_runnext(void) SYNC

If a procedure assumes that upon entry it must be in a critical section, it
will have the tag REQ_SYNC


The following locks can be acquired at anytime, but must be released before
any other locks are attempted - in other words, they have very short
life-span:

  SYSINFO

The following is a strict locking order:

  QVEC[n]_LOCK
  ipimsg_lock
  e->env_klock
  e->env_pd->envpd_klock
  MALLOC_LOCK
  pp->pp_klock
  ENV_LIST_LOCK
