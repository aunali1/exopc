This must be algebraic?

Run function to get coverage; it looks at values, you track and build
up a set.

Run coverage; it builds up a set.  Cannot intersect with the previous
one.

Add-c: make mod, coverage must change by the right amount.
Add-d: make mod, coverage domain must change by the right amount.

If overlap, must know this so you can retest, right?  Is speed going
to be a problem?

What are the rules for when these values can be modified.

How do you know where the index is?  Do they have to go through
and modify?   Allow it to be relocatable.  Massive hacks at all
levels.
