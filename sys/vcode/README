This is the x86 port of VCODE. It is based on the interface as
described in the April 28th doc/tutorial.ps that comes with Dawson's
0.06 VCODE release. This version has passed the regression tests
associated with the 0.06 release, with the exceptions listed in the
bugs section below.

Programs should include vcode.h and compile and link vcode.c.

An x86 disassembler is now provided, which can either be used
standalone or via v_dump.

Do a make test to run the regresion tests.

The source assumes that it is installed in a directory called vcode. 
If this is not the case create a link from the source's parent to it
and name the link vcode.

TODO:
 -- fix known bugs
 -- get around gcc'isms to improve code generation time
 -- improve generated code quality (especially what to do with argument regs)

BUGS:
 -- fairly bad namespace pollution
 -- v_jalp doesn't take a link register, but instead always uses the 
    vcode pseudo register v_ra
 -- floats and doubles are not supported
 -- I'm not sure if v_zero is a real VCODE pseudo register or not. Currently,
    it can only be used as the base register of loads and stores
 -- the total size of incoming args + locals + virtual registers cannot
    exceed 120 bytes. This is pretty stupid.
 -- v_save and v_restore are missing
