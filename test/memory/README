Usage: %s [--help] [-m #] [-j #]
--help: you get this message
-m amount of memory to malloc and test in kilobytes
-j number of simulaneous processes banging on the memory
-i number of iterations
with no flags it starts testing memory


usage:

running memory by itself, launches 4 jobs that mallocs 4 Megs and as
each jobs finishes it launches another (10 times).  This checks that
memory is being deallocated by processes properly.  By doing running a
total of 14 processes each allocating 4 Megs we know we are using more
of the total system memory.  The system will break if it is not
deallocating memory properly.
