This is a patch to apply to gdb-4.16.  

** This patch adds UDP communication to the remote debugging facility
of gdb.  The syntax is just like the TCP remote debugging syntax
except that "udp" is appended. Ex: "target remote fnord:9999udp"

** also, the configuration file for netbsd is changed so that UDP (as
well as TCP) is compiled into gdb.  so when you configure use 
./configure --target=i386-netbsd --host=i386-netbsd.
