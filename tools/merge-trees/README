!!! ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE !!!

Attempt at merging overlapping changes from multiple cvs trees. The situation
handled is where you have a local cvs tree and are trying to track changes
made by several other people's cvs trees. 

Suppose you're trying to track changes made in tree A and incorporate them
into B. Then you need to keep the latest and the next to latest copies
of tree A and your latest copy of tree B. Then run 

merge-trees B A.new A.old

You can optionally supply -n to tell merge-trees to not actually change
any files but instead print the status of each file.

Each file processed (CVS, obj, and .orig files are ignored) is printed
with a status of:

LA	Locally added (B has it but not A.new or A.old)
LD	Locally deleted (A.new and A.old have it but not B)
RA	Remotely added (B and A.old do not have it but A.new does)
RD	Remotely deleted (B and A.new do not have it but A.old does)
P	Needs merging
C	Needs merging but might have conflicts

Each file that is changed (those marked with P or C) is backed up into
it's name+.orig.
