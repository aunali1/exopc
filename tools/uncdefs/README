Usage: uncdefs.pl *.[ch]
Side-effects: leaves an original file in *.[ch].ori
and on the file itself it comments out any #include <sys/cdefs.h>,
removes __{BEGIN,END}_DECLS,__dead,__pure, and processes the macro:
#define __P(x) x.

Basically it removes the sys/cdefs.h dependency.  This tool is useful when
grabbing .c and .h files from /usr/include and /usr/src.
