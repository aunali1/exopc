Make sure your EXODEST variable points to your _private_ tree.  
Make sure your NFS ROOT (where the first process mounts its file system)
is logically the same as the directory pointed by EXODEST.  your NFS ROOT
is controlled by the variables the environment variables
NFS_ROOT_PATH and NFS_ROOT_HOST, which are used by the GNUmakefile in lib/libc

To use "tree", from the top level just type:

gmake

It will populate the directory pointed by EXODEST with directories like
etc, var, usr, and their corresponding files.  

ABOUT ACCOUNTS
The password files right now have a handful of accounts, all with password:
'exopc'
to add an account, add an entry in the file etc/master.passwd
then, from the 'etc' directory run the 'rebuild.passwd' script.
and if you want you can make sure their home directory always exists by
adding an entry in directories/GNUmakefile

The setup should be such, that is you compiled "csh, login, inetd, telnetd"
you should be able to telnet into your xok machine.

If there are problems, first verify that the directory mounted by the exokernel
which is shown in the console, matches the directory pointed by EXODEST.
