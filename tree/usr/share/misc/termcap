#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files, but also large
# numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and terminfo entries more complete
# and carefully tested than those in historical termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.ccil.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.  
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not. 
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency even if you don't
# use reorder).  Minor sections usually correspond to manufacturers or
# standard terminal classes.  Parenthesized words following manufacturer
# names are type prefixes or product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress :am: capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (:vb:) rather than :bl:.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should 
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv'.  
# 
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries. 
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tac(1m), the terminfo action checker soon
# to be distributed with ncurses.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL:
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, and vt100 up front in
# confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the file ufo.ti, and eyeball
# it for things you can identify. 
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## STANDARD AND SPECIAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and maker brands that are still
# quite common.
#

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward (and the vt52, way obsolete but still
# the basis of some emulations) are collected here. Older DEC terminals and
# micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#
# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio
# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the :xn: glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# :xn: right on vt100. The correct way to handle :xn: is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If :xn:
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than :is:/:ct:/:st: because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.

# VT520/VT525
#
# The VT520 is a monochrome text terminal capable of managing up to
# four independent sessions in the terminal.  It has multiple ANSI
# emulations (VT520, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, VT PCTerm, SCO Console)
# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing
# [F3] as the first key after power up, regardless of keyboard type.
# (vt520: I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string -- esr)
